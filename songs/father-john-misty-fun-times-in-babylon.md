    VERSE, pt 1

        F#m               B        (B7)
        Fun----- times in Babylon
                        E           F#m
        That's what I'm counting on


    VERSE, pt 2
                       E                              F#m
            Before the dam goes up at the foot of the sea
                           E                               F#m
            Before the new wing of the prison ribbon ceremony
                       E                                     F#m
            Before the star of the morning comes looking for me

    VERSE, pt 3
                Am    B                 E       F#m
                I------- would like to abuse my lungs
                      Am            B                E              F#m
                Smoke everything in sight with every girl I've ever loved
                Am              B             E                  F#m
                Ride around the wreckage on a horse knee-deep in blood

    REFRAIN
                    A        E          B      E
                    Look out Hollywood, here I come
        
        (repeat the chords above for each section below)

        Fun----- times in Babylon
        Mama, they've just begun

            Before they put me to work in a government camp
            Before they do my face up like a corpse and say get up and dance
            Before the beast comes looking for last year's rent

                I would like to abuse my lungs
                Smoke everything in sight with every girl I've ever loved
                Ride around my wreckage on a horse knee-deep in mud

                    Look out Hollywood, here I come
                    Look out Hollywood, here I come
                    Look out Hollywood, here I come
